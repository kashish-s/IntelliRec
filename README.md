# IntelliRec - A Reinforcement Learning based Recommendation System.

Recsim is a powerful tool for modelling user behaviour and generating simulated data for recommendation systems. However, one of its most significant limitations includes generalization, which consequently makes it a less flexible tool for Deep RL researchers. The research direction in this paper is to improve the e-commerce product recommendation scenario by using an Amazon Ratings dataset to model a Q-Learning-based agent in RecSim. The adapted version focuses on improving the relevance of recommendations and personalized user experiences while still leveraging the power of the original RecSim framework. The scenario implemented was evaluated using standard metrics such as precision and recall in addition to click-through rate, which provides a way to test the relevance of a given slate of recommendations. The combined use of Q-learning and CTR proved valuable for optimizing the recommendation process and enhancing user satisfaction. The findings demonstrate the potential of RecSim as a powerful tool for enhancing recommendation systems in e-commerce applications and prove that the modified RecSim framework can help focus on improving the adaptivity of the library across various recommendation scenarios.
